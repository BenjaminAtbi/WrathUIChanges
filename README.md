# Kingmaker UI changes

#### Remove Outline
when you activate highlight view, your party will not be surrounded by a green outline

#### Remember Spell Levels
when you select a character, the spellbook popup will default to the level it was at the last time you selected that character, rather than reverting to cantrips every time.
